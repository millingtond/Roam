The library houses over 500,000 volumes, including rare manuscripts from the medieval period.\n\nNotice the inscription above the entrance - it translates to 'For the Use of the Public', reflecting the founders' democratic ideals. The reading room inside features a stunning painted ceiling, though unfortunately it's not open to tourists.\n\nOur next stop is the National Museum. Continue straight ahead past the library.",

The highlight is the gallery of Polish paintings on the second floor, featuring works from the Romantic period.\n\nIf you have time after the tour, I highly recommend visiting the temporary exhibition hall.

Each one tells a story through its unique facade - look for the decorative elements that indicate the original owner's profession.\n\nIn the center of the square, you'll see the Town Hall. At noon, mechanical figures emerge from the clock tower - a tradition dating back to 1551.\n\nThis concludes our tour. Feel free to explore the cafes and shops around the square.
